# HRMS Django REST API

This project provides a backend API for both Employee and Admin dashboards using Django and Django REST Framework. All dashboard data is served from the API/databaseâ€”no static or dummy data is used.

## Features
- Employee CRUD (admin only)
- Employee dashboard data (employee only)
- Attendance (clock in/out, summary, history)
- Leave (apply, list, approve/reject)
- Announcements (list, create, delete)
- Notifications (list, create)
- Payroll (summary, history)

1. Create and activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install django djangorestframework
   ```
3. Run migrations:

   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
5. Start the server:

   ```
